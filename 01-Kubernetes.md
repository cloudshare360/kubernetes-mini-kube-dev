 Kubernetes' release was announced by Google in 2014 and the system's design was influenced by Google's internal cluster management system called Borg. Instead of keeping the idea to themselves, Google worked with the Linux Foundation to form a new organization called the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and donated Kubernetes as the first open source project under the purview of the CNCF. 
 - What is Kubernetes
    - Kubernetes, also known as "Kates" or K8s, is Greek for the word pilot or helmsman of a ship. 
    - Kubernetes has this name because it's a container orchestrator. Like the captain of a ship leading their crew
    - Kubernetes makes decisions about 
      - where and how containerized applications are launched on a server.   
      - when to scale up and down the number of application replicas
      - what to do when an application or server stops working.
      - Kubernetes is an open source project written in the programming language Go

Companys 
- Spoify - was using Helios and migrated to Kubernetes which is handling 10 million requests per second is a lot.
- Benefits
    - Kubernetes can handle it by scaling up the number of pods and nodes when needed and it will also scale those things down when there are fewer requests, providing automatic elasticity that saves you and your company money on compute resources
    - Kubernetes can run on any kind of server, 
      - on-prem data center, 
      - a public cloud
      - a hybrid of both

One can install Kubernetes on your own 
or 
you can use a managed Kubernetes service
- Managed Kubernetes Service Platforms
    - Google,
    - Amazon,
    - Microsoft,
    - IBM
    - Red Hat
    - DigitalOcean

Google created Cloud Native Computing Foundation and donated Kubernetes as the first open source project.
now CNCF provides support for Kubernetes
